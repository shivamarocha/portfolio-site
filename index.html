    My name is Shiva. I like to play poker, video games, & trade cryptocurrency.
    Trying out a vegan/vegeatarian diet as for now. I sell sneakers and other
    streetware for a living. I started this business when I was 19 about 5
    years. As a result I had dropped out of college and focused on my business
    full time.

    I am new to Las Vegas, moved back in Febuary. I was born and raised in
    Queens, NY so it has been an awkward adjustment living in Nevada but hoping
    all works out for the best. My goal is to take my busienss and creative
    skills and apply them in a technical sense to be able to make useful apps
    and websites for the streetware industry and beyond.
